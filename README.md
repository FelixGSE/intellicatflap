# Intelligent cat flapp

This repo contains an app to detect cats and control a cat flap based on what the cat brings home. 

This is work in progress and based on the idea of Ben Hamm.

## Run service on pi

To build and/or run the service, use the following:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To build a singe service, use

```
